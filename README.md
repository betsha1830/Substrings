# Substrings

# PROBLEM
# How many substrings are there from the user input and the dictionary provided.
# (if a word is found as a root word a prefixed or suffixed word that also counts).

# CASES
# 1- Takes two input ( 1- The word to be checked if it exists in the dictionary. 2- The dictionary itself)

# SOLUTION
# 1- Check input by iterating against the dictionary if the input matches as a word (eg input: low, dictionary: below. => this is a match)
